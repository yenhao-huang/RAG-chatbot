# University Data Crawling Solution Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the university data crawling solution implemented for the Study Abroad Agent chatbot. The solution enables automated collection of information about CS/EE master's programs from university websites.

## Solution Components

### 1. Planning & Documentation
- `docs/university_crawl_plan.md`: Detailed crawling strategy and implementation approach
- `docs/university_crawl_checklist.md`: Comprehensive checklist for execution and maintenance
- `README.md`: General information about the crawling system
- `university_crawling_solution.md`: Technical overview of the implementation
- `EXTENDING_CRAWLER.md`: Guide for adding support for additional universities

### 2. Implementation
- `script/university_crawler.py`: Main Python crawler implementation
- `script/run_crawler.sh`: Shell script for executing the crawler with logging

### 3. Output & Logging
- `data/university_programs.csv`: Collected university program data
- `logs/`: Directory containing execution logs

## Key Features

### Object-Oriented Design
- Abstract base class for common functionality
- Specific crawler implementations for each university
- Extensible architecture for adding new universities

### Robust Implementation
- Error handling and logging
- Respectful crawling with delays between requests
- Structured data output in CSV format

### User-Friendly Execution
- Simple shell script to run the crawler
- Automatic log file generation
- Success/failure reporting

## Current Implementation

The solution currently includes crawlers for:
1. Stanford University - EE MS
2. Carnegie Mellon University - ECE MS

Each crawler extracts the following information:
- University name
- Program name
- Location
- Degree type
- Specialization/track
- Application deadlines
- Tuition costs
- Scholarship information
- Language requirements
- Program focus (research-oriented vs industry exposure)

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml html5lib selenium
```

### Running the Crawler
```bash
cd crawl/script
./run_crawler.sh
```

### Output
- Data: `crawl/data/university_programs.csv`
- Logs: `crawl/logs/crawler_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## Extending to Additional Universities

To add support for more universities:

1. Follow the guide in `EXTENDING_CRAWLER.md`
2. Create a new crawler class inheriting from `BaseUniversityCrawler`
3. Implement the `crawl()` method for the specific university
4. Add the new crawler to `UniversityCrawlerOrchestrator`
5. Test the implementation

## Integration with RAG System

The CSV output is designed for easy integration with the existing RAG system:
1. Data can be processed to create embeddings
2. Embeddings can be stored in the FAISS vector database
3. The chatbot can retrieve relevant program information using semantic search

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks include:
1. Checking for website structure changes
2. Updating crawler implementations as needed
3. Monitoring log files for errors
4. Scheduling periodic crawling to keep data current

## Success Metrics

The solution meets the following success criteria:
- ✅ Successfully extracts data for target universities
- ✅ Clean, structured data in CSV format
- ✅ Error handling for failed extractions
- ✅ Documentation for extending to additional universities
- ✅ Integration-ready output for the RAG system

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
1. Selenium support for JavaScript-heavy websites
2. Proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking
3. More sophisticated rate limiting
4. Data validation and cleaning enhancements
5. Incremental updates to avoid re-crawling all data
6. Monitoring dashboard for crawling status and data quality
